Adapter piece for standard 3M half-face mask (6000, 7000 and FF-400 series masks, eg. popular 6200) to DAR viral/bacterial filters commonly found in hospitals 


This is a revision of a project that has been circulating on the internet for the last few days and it aims to solve some of the issues present in the original design:
1. Rectangular, asymmetric design for easier handling when coupling/decoupling with the mask
2. Shape of the adapter offers instant visual feedback of the correct placement - protecting from improper coupling and accidental disconnections
3. The filter has been directed towards the back and the sides, which offers several advantages:
  a. Air inlet has been directed away from the patient side, not towards it
  b. Upwards air inlet position is much closer to the intended use as described by the manufacturer's product specification
  c. Re-positioning of the filter allows for greater freedom of movement when a face shield is used
4. Wider flange offers extra seal around the adapter-mask interface
5. Filter piece is inserted in a way that even accidental removal of the cap from filter's luer-lock port does not expose the user to unfiltered air

Second filter can be replaced with a simple cap (will be soon added to the files) to reduce filter use - breathing is comfortable with even one filter.

[PRINTING INSTRUCTION]
0.2 mm layer height, PLA or PETG, supports are needed only for the outer brim - two ways to achieve this: 1. set 'overhang threshold' to 15 deg. or less 2. use support blocker to remove supports from the internal hollow chamber

Please note that the mask itself does not provide any filtration of the exhaled air! It is only intended to protect healthy individuals, eg. healthcare workers

This design would benefit from proper and rigorous testing to determine the quality of the seal, and maximum holding pressure - please contact me if you're interested in helping out.

This design is offered as a last resort, off-label use intended only for dire situations. Use at you own risk. Make sure to follow your local guidelines.
